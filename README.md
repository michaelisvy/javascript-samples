Project including lots of code samples on Javascript fundamentals

* Structure
Please note that folders `src` and `test` files have been put in the same `src` folder. 
I'm doing things this way because it is a samples project for training purpose (it's easier for beginners when the test is right next to the source file). 
In a real project, there should be a clear separation between `src` and `test`.

* Run all the tests
```
npm run test
```
